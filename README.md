The echo command to create and edit the .gitignore file. Enter the following command to create the file:

echo *.csv > .gitignore

This command creates a .gitignore file and adds a rule to ignore all files with a .csv extension.

Commit the .gitignore file and push it to my GitHub repository to make sure it takes effect on the remote repository.

git add .gitignore

git commit -m "Added .gitignore to exclude CSV files"

git push origin master

With the .gitignore file in place, Git will ignore any CSV files in the repository, preventing them from being pushed to GitHub. 

Can use the move command on Windows to move bikeshare.py script and data files into the local repository. 

# Moving the bikeshare.py script
move "C:\Users\Ezeizu Vitalis\Downloads\Udacity_project\workspace\home\bikeshare.py"

# Moving data files (if they are in a directory)
move "C:\Users\Ezeizu Vitalis\Downloads\Udacity_project\workspace\home\chicago.csv"
        
move "C:\Users\Ezeizu Vitalis\Downloads\Udacity_project\workspace\home\new_york_city.csv"

move "C:\Users\Ezeizu Vitalis\Downloads\Udacity_project\workspace\home\washington.csv"

Can use the git status command to see the changes made in the local repository. It will show that the files have been added or modified.

Git add command is used to stage the changes, and then commit with a message. 

git add .
git commit -m "Added bikeshare.py and data files"

Finally, git push command is used to push changes to my GitHub repository. This will sync with my local repository with the one on GitHub.


git push origin master

Now, bikeshare.py script and data files are in my local repository, and the changes are reflected on my GitHub fork. I can work on these files locally, commit my changes, and push them to my GitHub repository as needed.
